## Stargazers Over Time

[reading-go Star History and Stats](https://seladb.github.io/StarTrack-js/?u=developer-learning&r=reading-go)

Go Learning and Sharing:

- [Night Reading Go](https://github.com/developer-learning/reading-go/labels/Go%20%E5%A4%9C%E8%AF%BB)

*We will arrange a meeting one night per week to read the Go source code. If you're a newcomer you can visit here.**[The path of learning Go](https://github.com/developer-learning/learning-golang)**.*
>Our reading includes: Go Standard Library, Open Source Project.

- [Daily reading](https://github.com/developer-learning/reading-go/labels/%E6%AF%8F%E6%97%A5%E9%98%85%E8%AF%BB)

*If you join these meetings it means you want to develop and learn, and you made a promise to yourself to do your best. But you have to understand one point: in here we are contributing to each other; there is no one-sided giving or taking. We can learn and discuss together but we cannot help you to stay motivated, nor can we teach and guide you every step.*

## Our Goal

We hope everyone will learn Go deeply and grow to become a senior Gopher!

## Our Approach

We will choose a leader to read/walk-thorugh the Go source code to everyone, during which we will tackle the difficult algorithms and learn the tricks in the code together. If we encounter problems or have doubts, we can collaboratively research and find answers.

>Reading Principle: Choose a package and read a `.go` file from top to bottom. We will review the file step by step but we won't dive into any logic that is outside of the package being reviewed.

## Our Spirit

Open Source! Open Source! Open Source! (important things need to be said thrice :-) )

>We hope anyone who is interested will join us, to help make "Night Reading Go" an open source community that can benefit everyone.
